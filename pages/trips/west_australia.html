            <h1>Western Australia</h1>

        
            <p>
                I don't know if it was the same for you, but for me, Australia has always been associated with the most distant and exotic place in the world. As a kid, it felt like there was simply nowhere farther to go. Stories and books about that vast continent sparked my imagination and created a kind of mysterious aura around the place.
                When I grew up and started traveling, I still didn't think I'd get there anytime soon, mainly because of the high cost of flights and living expenses.
                That's why, like with many of my trips, this journey ended up being a surprise.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
                The idea for the winter 2025 trip started after I returned from Taiwan. That's when my friend Grześ suggested we go somewhere as a group of friends. Kozak (Staszek) quickly jumped on board with the idea, and just like that, the three of us were in. A few months later, right before the summer of 2024, we found some really good flights from Kraków to Singapore. We booked them without much hesitation, and from that moment the decision-making process began - one thing was clear: we wouldn't be staying in Singapore for more than two days.
                It took quite a while before we made the next moves - basically the whole summer. In the meantime, things got a bit complicated: Kozak's summer plans to earn a lot of money working in Germany didn't work out, and he ended up without funds for the trip, which was shaping up to be quite expensive. That made things a bit tricky for him and for us in terms of planning.
                Finally, sometime in October, we managed to meet and settle on a destination. We were choosing between Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, etc. We decided we were just too close to Australia to pass it up - and who knows when we'd get such a chance again - so we bought tickets to Perth.
                After doing some research, we settled on the west coast of Australia because of its natural attractions, remoteness, and cheaper, more convenient flights. Trying to balance an epic trip with Staszek's very tight budget, we decided to spend only 8 days in Australia, then fly to Kuala Lumpur and spend the remaining 7 days in mainland Malaysia, finally taking a bus back to Singapore.
                And that's how the plan for this amazing journey came together.
            </p>

            <h6>Flights and Singapore</h6>

            <p>
                All of us were dropped off at the airport together by Kozak's brother. We boarded the plane and took off for Istanbul, where we had our only short layover. At the terminal in Turkey, we quickly played a round of FIFA and kicked around a zośka (a small sand-filled footbag - definitely my top travel gadget of the year, perfect for killing time at the airport).
                Unfortunately, our flight was delayed by about two hours, but eventually, we managed to leave Istanbul. After a 12-hour flight, we finally landed in Singapore. Everything at the airport went smoothly, although we were a bit stressed because Staszek brought 3 kilograms of Polish sausage with him to save money on food in Australia - I feel like that should've been confiscated, but somehow we got lucky.
                We left the terminal around 7 PM and headed to our capsule hostel.

            <br />


            <p>
                We just dropped off our bags and headed out into the city. We preferred to explore at night, hoping it would be cooler than in the morning (since we had a flight to Australia at 3 PM the following day). We were aiming for Gardens by the Bay, but we made a small mistake - we didn't check how long it would take to get there. It ended up being a 4-hour walk that lasted until 1 AM.
                We took a scenic route to enjoy the view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel skyline and eventually reached the Gardens by the Bay. We spent some time there resting and admiring the stunningly colorful trees. These gardens are famous for their artificial, illuminated "supertrees," covered in various plants. By that time it was already around midnight, so it was quiet and empty, although still very warm and humid.
                We then wanted to go up to the rooftop of the famous hotel next to the park, but unfortunately it was already closed. Completely exhausted, we finally made our way back toward the hostel area, where we grabbed something to eat - even though it was already 2 AM. We ordered a massive portion of curry chicken with rice, served on a huge banana leaf, and nearly a 2-liter coconut to drink. The whole meal cost us around 5 USD per person.
                After that feast, we finally went for some well-deserved rest.
            </p>

            <br />


            <p>
                In the morning, we took a walk around the city and went for breakfast at one of the local street food spots. It was a pleasant surprise that in such an expensive place like Singapore, eating out is at least half the price of what it costs in Poland (if not even cheaper). Once we satisfied our hunger, we hopped on the metro and headed back to the airport.
                We took the airport shuttle train, which gives you a view of the famous indoor waterfall inside the terminal (a tip for travelers - the waterfall is in Terminal 2, in the area before the security gates). Not much later, we were already in line to board the plane.
                A funny story: in addition to the 3 kg of sausage, Kozak was also carrying a massive coconut he had saved from the night before so he could finish the flesh later, along with a boiled egg leftover from breakfast - definitely the weirdest carry-on ever (especially since the egg cracked open inside the bag). Despite Staszek's... interesting baggage, we made it onto the plane and were finally on our way to the land of kangaroos.

            <br />
            <br />
            <h6>Landing in Australia</h6>
            <p>
                We arrived in Australia in the evening, after 9 PM, and wanted to hit the road as soon as possible to get as far as we could that day - this was a key part of our plan. However, we were delayed by Kozak's sausages - they were confiscated, nearly $100 worth of sausages gone to waste (not that I didn't warn him this would happen).
                After that, we finally found our rental car and set off, stopping by a store on the way. Our plan for those 8 days was to head north, ideally reaching Coral Bay by the Ningaloo Reef. To make that happen without too much stress, we needed to get as close to the town of Geraldton as possible on the first day, so we drove for quite a while through the night.
                We passed a few kangaroos standing by the road - at that point we didn't yet realize how dangerous it can be to drive at night in Australia. Finally, around 2 AM, we stopped in a small town called Leeman, where we set up a little campsite in a park. Grzesiu slept in the car, and Kozak and I pitched our tents.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Even though the sleeping conditions were excellent, it wasn't a pleasant night. I fell asleep sometime after 3 AM and had to get up by 6 due to the sun heating up the tent and a bunch of birds loudly singing in the trees. Well - what kind of trip lets you sleep in anyway? We had breakfast and hit the road.
                When we reached Geraldton, one of the biggest screw-ups of all my travels happened. As I was about to pay for fuel, I realized my waist bag with my passport, credit card, and all other important documents was missing. I figured I must've left it about 40 minutes earlier at a gas station where we stopped for coffee. I called them, and luckily they said they'd found it and were holding onto it for me.
                In the end, such a serious issue as losing a passport didn't have major consequences, apart from the 2 hours we lost driving back to get it. Good thing it was me who was paying in Geraldton - if I hadn't noticed it then, we might have had to drive a lot further back. After all the chaos, we continued heading north.
            </p>


            <br />
            <br />
            <h6>Kalbarri</h6>
            <p>
                Our first attraction was the pink lake at Hutt Lagoon. I'd seen a place like this before, but here the intensity of the pink was truly unbelievable. The lake is also huge, and you can walk on parts of it. I snapped some of the best shots of the entire trip there, including drone photos, and then we hit the road again.
                Eventually, with quite a delay, we made it to Kalbarri National Park. That was a traumatic experience. When we got out of the car, it was OVER 45 DEGREES CELSIUS outside. On top of that, there were swarms of Australian flies that had absolutely no shame - flying into your ears, eyes, and nose - and you couldn't swat them away.
                We first went to a lookout point over the Murchison River, but quickly ran back to the car and headed to another spot - the famous trail called "The Loop". It's the park's best trail, following the riverbed of the Murchison. We were really excited to hike it, but unfortunately, it was closed due to the risk of heat strokes. We only walked 400 meters to Nature's Window, a beautiful rock formation featured on tons of covers and postcards.
                Even that short walk drained us. The whole thing maybe lasted 30 minutes, but we were completely wrecked. We decided we needed a break, so we drove back to the town of Kalbarri, where we relaxed on the beach and cooled off in the ocean.
            </p>

            <br />


            <p>
                After a quick reset, we hit the road again to cover as much distance as possible before dark. Around 8 PM, we stopped at a random roadside parking area by the tracks, somewhere deep in the bush. It turned out to be a rough night. As soon as we turned on our flashlights, we were swarmed by bugs, spiders, cockroaches, and other nasty creatures - some as big as a thumb or even a hand.
                Because of that, we quickly locked ourselves in our tents and the car. But within an hour, we all came back out. It was around 38°C, and the red earth was radiating even more heat. There was no airflow inside the tents, and you'd be dripping with sweat even if you just lay there without moving. I was honestly scared I'd get seriously dehydrated if I managed to fall asleep in that heat.
                So from 9 PM to midnight, the three of us sat on a bench, unable to sleep, just waiting for the temperature to drop. We stayed in the dark to avoid attracting more bugs, and Kozak would occasionally scan the surroundings with his red flashlight.
                Surprisingly, those three hours weren't as bad as we expected - some good conversation and a cold beer helped pass the time. Finally, around midnight, the temperature dropped enough for us to fall asleep. It was a tough night.

            <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <h6>Shark Bay</h6>
            <p>
                By 9 AM it was already 38°C, so we had no choice but to get up. We hit the road toward Shark Bay. After about two hours of driving, we stopped at Billabong Roadhouse, where stepping out of the car hit us with 45°C heat. It's honestly one of the most atmospheric gas stations I've ever been to - the place just oozes Australian outback vibes. We filled up the car and had breakfast somewhere in the shade, melting in the heat.
                We kept going and soon reached the peninsula. The first attraction was Shell Beach - a stunning white beach made entirely of tiny shells instead of sand. We took a quick dip to cool off and then continued onward. Our next short stop was at a lookout point over the bay, where you can spot various sea creatures - we saw a few sharks from up above.
                Eventually, we made it to Monkey Mia, a nature reserve and resort area home to a lot of interesting animals. Once there, we decided to finally take it easy and spent the entire day chilling on the beach. Dolphins were swimming right near the shore, a pelican was lounging nearby, and emus were strolling along the beach.
                We swam, walked, laid around, and just relaxed. In the evening, we headed back to the nearby town, stopped by a store, and pitched our tents in a park by the water.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h6>Coral Bay</h6>
            <p>
                We woke up at sunrise. Kozak had been sleeping without a tent on the beach nearby, and was woken up by a dog licking his cheek. We quickly packed up and returned to Monkey Mia because, as part of our entrance fee, we had a dolphin feeding show included. The dolphins swam up to a very shallow water, and the reserve staff told us about their habits and fed them snacks. After the show, we bought some souvenirs and headed back to town. There, we stopped at a gas station for refueling and breakfast, when a ranger came up to us and told us that wild camping wasn't allowed, and that we could be fined. He also mentioned that the entire peninsula was part of a UNESCO site, so that's why camping was prohibited. The dog that had licked Kozak was actually the ranger's dog. We apologized and hit the road north to Coral Bay. Our plan was to drive the whole way in one go.
                The road was long, and we passed Carnarvon, which has many mango plantations. We made a quick stop at the Tropic of Capricorn and took a picture with the sign. Finally, after 4-5 hours, we reached our final destination. We were super happy because we still had about 2 hours of sunlight left and could swim in the ocean. The town of Coral Bay is located right next to the Ningaloo Reef. It's the second-largest reef in Australia, and some even consider it better than the Great Barrier Reef because it's more compact and better protected. The town is a popular tourist spot, with plenty of campgrounds and tour companies, and the beach is more crowded than in Monkey Mia. It doesn't spoil the vibe, though, because most people are locals or Australians from other parts of the country. They spend the whole day in the water, wearing hats and hanging out with friends in circles while sipping beers - what a beautiful life.
                The water here is very warm, and the beginning of the reef with colorful fish is only about a meter from the shore. We spent the rest of the day swimming and watching the sunset. For the night, Grzesiu and I decided to stay in the cheapest backpacker hostel to shower, catch up on sleep, and rest, while Kozak, due to his budget and the very convenient beaches, chose to sleep in the wild. He had our room number, so in case he needed to, he could always come to us. We relaxed and went to sleep.

            <p>
                The next day, I had planned to go on a diving trip, and the guys were going to the beach, with a return in the evening, but unfortunately, I received information that diving wasn't available that month. I wasn't sure about snorkeling, so I was a bit sad that I wouldn't fulfill my dream of seeing mantas. After breakfast, we headed to the beach, and Kozak and I went to the tour office nearby to ask about possible options. The lady presented us with an offer, and we decided to change our plans a little, booking tours for the next day, and only after that would we return (we had a little time to spare). I decided to go on a full-day snorkeling trip to watch mantas, while Kozak chose a 3-hour snorkeling trip with turtles. Happy that we would stay here another day, we returned to Grzesiu and told him everything. The rest of the day: beach time and chilling.
                We had one more attraction: we went on a 30-minute walk to Shark Sanctuary, a small bay near the town, where dozens of young sharks find shelter. We managed to see a few of them with the drone and from the shore, but unfortunately, we weren't very lucky, as there weren't many around. The rest of the day was spent relaxing, playing zośka, etc. We watched the sunset from the water, and in the evening, Grzesiu went back to the hostel, while Kozak and I were supposed to sleep outside. However, there were lots of lightning and storms around, so not wanting to take a risk, we went to the dorm, but before that, we had a few beers on a bench. In the dorm, we met a few Australians working in the town, who recommended some good snorkeling spots in the area, but that's for the next day.

            <p>
                Early in the morning, I left the hostel and headed for my tour, which started at 8:30. Kozak's tour was at 1 PM, so in the meantime, he went for a reconnaissance mission to the beach that our dormmates recommended yesterday. I arrived at the tour company office, where they gave me the entire plan and rules for the trip. Not long after, we headed to the jetty to board the boat. Our group wasn't large, and the boat was a two-story tourist ship. It took us about 30 minutes to reach the reef.
                For the first 2 hours, we had planned snorkeling at two spots rich in various marine creatures. We swam with turtles, coming as close as 1 meter to them. We saw several sharks of different types, stingrays, octopuses, and more. There were vibrant coral formations everywhere around us. The water was teeming with life. We had the chance to see well-camouflaged octopuses (which can change color). Twice we managed to encounter huge stingrays (Pastinachus sephen). There were a few sharks hiding near the bottom under rock overhangs. After these amazing experiences, we returned to the boat and sailed to a spot where we were supposed to search for mantas.
                The tour company had a plane in the air, which flew above the reef, spotting different animals (since the water is shallow and the manta is a large creature, it's easy to spot against the bright sand). It didn't take long before we were jumping into the water. I looked ahead, and towards us was a beautiful creature, majestically waving its fins. It was calm and gentle, but also commanded respect. Seeing it with my own eyes was an indescribable experience. When the manta passed us, we could follow it, but we weren't allowed to get too close or dive down. Thanks to the fins we were given, I was able to keep up with the creature for several minutes before I had to let go. We spent the next 2 hours searching for and chasing mantas.
                Finally, we were tired enough, and the boat started heading back to the town. Throughout the entire trip, we had a professional photographer with an underwater camera, who took a whole session of pictures for us. We could purchase the photos at the tour office, which I did. After everything settled at the office, I returned to the beach, where I met up with Grzesiu and Kozak. We shared all the stories, and Kozak said that we definitely need to go to the beach that he was on in the morning (the one recommended to us). After some negotiation, we decided that since we would not drive far today, we'd go there in the evening and return in the morning.
                Since we didn't have a 4x4 car, we parked at the start of the road to the beach and had to walk the 40-minute path on foot. We arrived 20 minutes before sunset and immediately jumped into the water. The reef near the beach was almost the same as the one on the tour. There were plenty of fish and colorful corals, some stingrays, and even turtles. It was also the first time I swam with sharks completely on my own (I met 3). Unfortunately, it quickly got dark, and we started heading back. Once we returned to Coral Bay, Grzesiu went to the hostel, and Kozak and I set up camp on the beach, where we surprisingly had a very comfortable night.

            <h6>Road back</h6>
            <p>
                In the morning, I was woken up by flies, so I escaped by sitting in the water, from where I admired the beautiful sunrise. Not long after, Kozak woke up too, and we went to Grzesiu's hostel. We had breakfast, did some small shopping, filled up the car, and topped off our water bottles at the hostel. Finally, we set off on our way back.
                We drove all day, stopping at various places to refuel. We made a short stop at the Tropic of Capricorn sign, took a quick break in Carnarvon, etc. A longer stop was made again at the Billabong station, which we had enjoyed so much on the other way. We also stopped on a hill to admire the views. Finally, in the evening, we arrived at the town of Leeman (the same one where we stayed the first night). We were shocked: just 5 hours earlier, at the stop in Billabong, it was 44°C, but in Leeman, it was only 24°C, a 20-degree difference in just 5 hours!!!! We were actually cold. When Kozak opened his cooler, the temperature inside had stayed the same, and the heat hit us like a wave. It was a really interesting anomaly.
                We explored the town a bit since it was still light out, and later spent the evening on a bench chatting among ourselves. When Grzesiu went to sleep, Kozak and I went for a walk, during which we met a very nice couple from the town, and we had a great conversation. Finally, around 11 PM, we headed to our tents, which we set up in the park.

            <p>
                The last night in Australia, like every other, wasn't the best: at 3 AM, the sprinklers in the entire park turned on, pumping a large amount of water into the tents. Everything, including the sleeping bags, got soaked. Kozak had to sleep in the car, but fortunately, I managed to sleep relatively normally in my tent. When morning came, we were extremely sleep-deprived. We packed up quickly and headed for breakfast to a nearby town. After the meal, we set off energetically towards Perth, stopping on the way at Nambung National Park, specifically at Pinnacles Desert. It's a place with lots of vertical rock formations scattered across yellow sand. The landscape felt like something out of a sci-fi movie; you could easily film scenes from other planets here. We really enjoyed it, especially since it was the only place where we managed to get close to kangaroos. The ranger we met there recommended a few more spots in the park, but we didn't have time to explore them further because we had to rush to the city to make sure we had time to see something there.

            <h6>Perth</h6>
            <p>
                After 2 hours, we finally arrived in Perth. The city is huge, although we learned from the locals that it's only large in terms of area, as the population isn't that big. We headed straight to Kings Park, without much of a plan, and we didn't regret our decision. It's a massive park located on a hill with a view of the entire city (especially Downtown). There are a lot of paths, meadows, ponds, and scenic spots to relax in nature. Inside the park, there's also a large botanical garden with an impressive variety of plants, and the park is free to visit. Parrots and other wonderful birds fly around the trees, and the air is filled with the scent of various flowers. Honestly, I could imagine moving to Perth just for this park - it's an absolute must-see.

            <p>
                After we finally left the park, we went for a short walk to downtown, and then returned to our car. We drove toward the airport area and repacked. We cleaned up the car, went to the car wash, and topped up the gas tank. We also had dinner at McDonald's. There was a small surprise, though, because among the many seashells Staszek had collected, many of them had live crabs inside, which had been slowly dying in our trunk for the last 5 days. As you can imagine, the smell was not very pleasant. Finally, we returned the car and went to the airport, where customs confiscated Kozak's seashells. Tired, we boarded the plane and said goodbye to wonderful Australia. Now, a new adventure awaited us in Malaysia - we were flying to Kuala Lumpur.

            <h6>Summary</h6>
            <p>
                And that was our journey to the west coast of the land of kangaroos. It was an incredible trip with many challenges and demands, but still worth every bit of effort and every sleepless night. I think it will be remembered for a long time as one of the best trips of my life. I am extremely grateful for every moment of this trip and for being able to share it with such wonderful companions. And if anyone is still hesitating or scared to go to Australia... buy those tickets and go see Ningaloo! From Perth we flew on to Malaysia for next adventure, but that will be described in another thread.

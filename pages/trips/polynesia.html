            <h1>Polynesia</h1>

            <p>
                I was a young teenager when Facebook recommended me a travel profile called "Boczne Szlaki". It was run by a guy who was hitchhiking around the world and had traveled all over South and Central America. I had been fascinated by travel since childhood, but at that time, I never would have thought I could go anywhere beyond Europe. It was this profile that made me believe in myself and realize that fulfilling dreams of visiting the most remote corners of the Earth is real and achievable - and that even I could do it.
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boczneszlaki/" target="_blank">Boczne szlaki</a>
            <br />

            <p>
                At that time, the author was in Polynesia, where he stayed for several months, posting vlogs about his experience. From the very first moment, I fell in love with this place. The stunning, uninhabited atolls, towering jungle-covered volcanoes, incredibly kind people, and the simplicity of life completely captivated my mind. To me, it was paradise on Earth and my ultimate travel goal. Living there became the pinnacle of my dreams. From that moment on, Polynesia took over my thoughts.
            </p>

            <p>
                I never would have expected that I'd fulfill my biggest travel dream in just the third year of my wandering around the world. I wasn't planning it, thinking that, it was too expensive and too ambitious. For the summer of 2024, my main plan was some form of sailing adventure - I had long wanted to experience life at sea (which is also high on my dream list). It was supposed to be a solo trip since I felt that was the last thing I needed to truly call myself a proper traveler.
                At first, I considered joining a cargo ship, but that idea quickly fell through. After a few weeks of thinking, I remembered Workaway, a platform listing places where you can exchange help and work for accommodation and food. I started searching for boat-related opportunities. After a few days of research, I found several offers, but most were for boats docked in harbors. And then, finally - one single listing in Polynesia. No major requirements. A guy had a boat and one available spot, so he was looking for someone to sail with him.
                I reached out, but it was too early for a confirmation. He told me to contact him three months before my arrival. I wasn't going to wait - I bought my tickets immediately. It turned out that flights from Paris were half the price compared to those from Poland. The uncertainty of whether I'd get a spot on the boat didn't change anything. Even if it didn't work out, I'd still be in Polynesia - I'd figure something out.
                It was hard to believe - my biggest dream had just come true. I was flying to Polynesia.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the departure date approached, my preparations entered more advanced stages. The trip was planned for three weeks: two in Polynesia, a one-day layover in San Francisco, and four days in France on the way back. I drafted a Plan B in case the boat option fell through, and it turned out so well that I even started considering skipping the Workaway offer.
                My doubts aligned perfectly with the news that my potential host wouldn't be able to take me in. So, Plan B it was. I scoured maps for the most isolated island with an airport, read about different archipelagos, and checked flight connections. Eventually, I made my choice: one week on Ahe Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago, followed by a week on Tahiti.
                My vision was simple: a hammock, a beach, and pure spontaneity. I had no idea what was waiting for me, but I didn't care - because I was going there for my dreams.

            <p>
                Like most journeys, this one had to start at an airport. My mom drove me there, gave me a hug, and waved as I walked into the glass-fronted terminal of Krak√≥w Balice. The first flight to Paris passed quickly. Once there, the city was still buzzing - it had only been a few weeks since the Olympics ended, and the whole place was still vibrating with energy.
                I had to transfer to Paris Orly Airport, so I rushed to the metro. Once there, I grabbed a quick lunch and replied to messages from friends and family. This was my first solo trip - and such a distant one - so naturally, everyone was a bit stressed.
                While waiting in line to board, I noticed a few Polynesian-looking passengers, and that's when it truly hit me - how close I was. The flight lasted 10 hours before we landed in San Francisco for a refueling stop. Unfortunately, we still had to go out of the plane and go through a whole set of procedures.
                To make things worse, I started feeling feverish. Before the trip, practically everyone around me had been sick, and it was a miracle I hadn't caught anything earlier. I popped a few pills and after a while, the fever started to ease.
                The second flight - another 10 hours (making it 22 hours total since I left Paris) - was spent watching Moana and catching up on sleep. Finally, at 6 AM local time, I landed in the most beautiful country I had ever seen.
            </p>

            <span class="post-img-label">Flights</span>
            <br />

            <p>
                As soon as I stepped off the plane, I was greeted by smiling Polynesians playing on ukulele. I quickly passed through immigration and got to work - buying a SIM card and withdrawing some cash. Then, I hopped into a taxi to my hotel.
                I had a small chat with the driver - he told me that Ahe was a complete outback, but the locals were incredibly kind and would surely welcome me with open arms. Feeling optimistic, I got out of the car and checked into my hotel.
                After dropping off my luggage, I did some quick shopping and ordered a taxi to take me to the start of the trail leading up Mount Aorai. Turns out, the road was in such bad shape that only one taxi driver was willing to take people there - hence the steep price of $45 one way.
                The driver was super friendly - we got along well, and he even gave me his contact info in case I needed a ride back or any help. He also warned me to be careful, as I was heading out pretty late (by this time, the sun could already be scorching), and I might be feeling the effects of jet lag.
                By around 9 AM, I was at the trailhead, ready to start the hike.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h6>Mount Aorai</h6>
            <p>
                The initial part of the trail led through dense jungle, with the path winding steeply upward. The thick vegetation kept the sun from fully breaking through, making for a pleasant, shaded hike. Along the way, I passed all sorts of tropical plants - avocado trees, melons, and more.
                After more than an hour of walking, I reached higher elevations. From that point on, I was rewarded with uninterrupted views of the ocean, the skyline of Papeete, deep valleys, and surrounding peaks. The narrow path hugged the mountainside, with a steep drop on one side. I was in awe. Under my breath, I kept thanking God for the chance to be here. The air was filled with the fresh, earthy scent of the forest. Everything was so vibrant and colorful that it was impossible not to feel overwhelmed with admiration.

            <p>
                At some point, I arrived at a small hut that serves as a potential overnight shelter - a key milestone on the trail. Ahead of me stood the massive summit of Mount Aorai. To reach it, I had to take a very narrow path running along the ridge, climbing steeply upwards. From here, the trail became significantly more difficult. Ropes were fixed in several sections, and careful footing was required. Thorny plants scraped my calves as I pushed forward.
                I kept climbing until I reached a point where I only had half a liter of water left. The sun was brutal, I was severely thirsty, running on an empty stomach, still haven't slept after a 22-hour journey and had a fever few hours ago. I didn't want to risk extreme exhaustion within the first five hours of my stay in Polynesia. At about two-thirds of the way to the top, I made the tough call to turn back.
                I took a few drone shots of the incredible scenery and started descending quickly. On my way down, I passed a few climbers, stopped briefly at the hut, and texted my taxi driver, asking him to pick me up and bring some water.

            <p>
                When he finally arrived, he was stunned. He said most hikers start this trail around 3 or 4 AM, yet I had nearly completed it after setting off at 8. He was also impressed by my pace.
                On the way back, he gave me a short city tour and shared his thoughts on Polynesian independence, we both agreed that the region should not be called French Polynesia, but just Polynesia.
            </p>

            <p>
                After that adventure, I took a quick shower, relaxed, and headed to a local BBQ spot recommended by my driver - turns out BBQ is hugely popular in Polynesia. I ordered a steak and, out of curiosity, tried a small starter made from cow heart.
                By the evening, I returned to the hotel and took some rest before my flight to Ahe the next day. I was a bit stressed and anxious - tomorrow, I'd be stepping into the great unknown.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h6>Journey to Ahe</h6>

            <p>

                On the second day, I woke up before sunrise and went to a few stores that were already open at that hour. I needed to buy a knife because I planned to wild camp for a whole week on Ahe. Unfortunately, my mission was unsuccessful.
                I took a taxi to the airport and waited for my flight. It was a fairly small aircraft. Inter-island flights here operate in a somewhat unusual way: on the way to Ahe, we stopped at three different islands, dropping off and picking up passengers.
            </p>

            <p>
                When we finally landed, it was cloudy, and it looked like it might rain. However, as soon as I stepped outside, I realized it was very warm. The airport building was really just a single room, staffed by two people who only worked there when a plane arrived. There was a small bathroom and a tiny shop. Posters of the only two guesthouses on the island hung on the walls, along with warnings about dengue fever (a mosquito-borne disease). Only a couple of people landed here with me. There were also a few locals inside the building, waiting for packages delivered by the plane.
                After collecting my luggage, I started repacking and preparing my gear for the journey ahead. At that moment, a local man approached me and said something in French - I didn't understand a word, but I used Google Translate to tell him that I hadn't come to visit anyone and that I was traveling solo.
                Five minutes later, when the building had emptied, someone ran inside, saying that people were waiting for me. I grabbed my backpack and stepped outside, where the same man that was talking to me previously was waving and inviting me onto a boat. Well, I got in - I'd heard from people on the internet and in Tahiti that Polynesians are very friendly and kind, often inviting travelers to stay with them.
                Before I knew it, I was speeding through the middle of the atoll, heading straight for the village. After about 20 minutes, we arrived at a tiny harbor in the heart of the village and switched to a pickup truck, which took us to a house. My host turned out to be Temarii. Without exchanging a word, he offered me an entire building at the back of his property and told me I could stay there.

            <span class="post-img-label">1) House I was living in 2) From inside of the house 3) My neighbour</span>

            <p>
                I was in shock. I had barely landed, and I was already being taken under someone's roof. The best part was that Temarii didn't speak English, and I didn't speak French. I unpacked and thought that since I was already staying at Temu's place (as he told me to call him), I might as well make myself useful. So I offered to help with something. He handed me some tools, and told me that I can change a tire on his a bicycle.
                A little later, I took the same bike for a ride around the village. Tenukupara, as it is called, is the only settlement on the island (although many small houses are scattered along the coast). It's very small, with literally just two intersecting roads, one church and cemetery, one post office, one school, one sports field, a small port, one shop - and that's about it.
                The village is located about 20 - 30 minutes by boat from the airport, on the southeastern edge of the atoll. The locals live off fishing - whatever they catch, they eat, and any surplus is sold to buy ingredients they can't produce themselves. A plane arrives once a week, as does a cargo ship.
                Electricity comes from solar panels, and water is collected from rainfall. You could say they live in the most sustainable way possible. Life on the island is very simple: you wake up whenever you want, catch a few fish in the most beautiful water I've ever seen, and in the afternoon, you either relax, play volleyball with the whole village, or sit around the local shop chatting.
                Ahhh, what a beautiful life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Aside from the bike ride, not much happened on the first day. I went for a walk, took a swim in the ocean, and had a meal with Temu's family (rice with fish). I mentioned the family, so who else lived there? It was Temu's family home, but his brother lived there with his wife and son. As it happened, Temarii was just visiting for a couple of weeks at that time.

            <br />

            <p>
                Nights on Ahe are very warm. My hut didn't even have a door to close, so I slept barely covered by my sleeping bag in the open air. The only serious problem was the mosquitoes - there were an awful lot of them. They were smaller than the ones in Europe, so you couldn't hear or feel them when they bit. At least the bites didn't itch. I was worried about them because it was impossible to avoid getting bitten, and everywhere there were warnings about dengue fever.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next day, I woke up with the sunrise, so I quickly grabbed my camera and ran to the beach. Later, we had breakfast together: fish, rice, salad, and hardtack (since there is no bakery on the island, hardtack serves as a substitute for bread), along with a big coffee, drunk from soup bowls, with powdered milk. After the meal, I went back to my place and launched my drone to see what the island looked like from the air. Later, Temu called me, saying we were going fishing.

            <br />

            <p>
                First, we had to prepare the gear: we tied pieces of metal and hooks to long fishing lines, got gloves ready, packed ice for the cooler, and so on. Once we were ready, we headed out.
                First, we took the boat to a motu on the other side of the island (a motu is a small piece of land in the shallows surrounded by water, like a tiny island). There, using a three-pronged spear, we hunted for large land crabs. We also collected a few broken buoys that had washed ashore and searched the shallows for fish. Once we were done, we changed the boat engine oil and rewarded ourselves with fresh coconuts straight from the tree.
                Then, we finally set out onto the lagoon to fish. The method was simple: we baited a long fishing line with a piece of crab, let it sink all the way to the bottom, and held the line by hand to feel for any bites. When we felt a tug, we pulled up the line and put the fish in the cooler. After about 30 minutes of fishing, I had caught two fish.
                The next task was securing new buoys. We took the boat to the middle of the lagoon, where I was given a mask and snorkel before jumping into the water. It was an incredible feeling - my first time swimming in such deep water, with nothing visible below or around me. While I held onto the buoys, Temu dived - sometimes as deep as seven meters - to tie them to ropes marking private fishing areas. It was an amazing sight to witness.
                After a good few hours of work, we finally returned home.

                After we got back, Temu prepared a meal using the fish I had caught. We ate it with great appetite and then took some time to rest.
                In the evening, I went for another walk around the village and watched the sunset at the port. The sky on this island had an incredible color, transitioning from deep red through orange and pink to dark navy blue.

                The next day started similarly - we headed out to the lagoon again. Our first task was tying more buoys to the lines marking the fishing areas. This time, Temu got me some fins, so I had a good swim.
                Next, we grabbed small spearguns and moved toward the shallow waters, where life was thriving - colorful fish straight out of "Finding Nemo". We even saw a shark! Unfortunately, the speargun broke, so we returned empty-handed that day.
                Back home, we had our usual fish-based meal and then relaxed.

                In the evening, it turned out the adventure wasn't over - Temu and his brother told me we were heading out to the open ocean for a full night of fishing. They were after what they called the "cousin of the sardine" - apparently the best bait for tuna.
                We set off at dusk, stopping first at their friends' place on a nearby motu. They traded a pack of fish for some gasoline and some jamaican green plant (if you know what I mean), then we continued on. As we crossed "The Pass" - the only channel where the lagoon connects to the ocean - a breathtaking sunset painted the horizon.
                Moments later, darkness fell so completely that I couldn't even see my own hand. We fished for about two hours using a similar method as before. At one point, Temu's brother accidentally caught a small shark, and another time, a cargo ship passed by, carrying goods to be unloaded in the port the next morning.
                Unfortunately, after a few hours, seasickness hit me hard. I usually have no trouble on the water, but with no horizon or fixed point to focus on, my inner ear got completely disoriented. The feeling was awful, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I didn't catch any more fish that night.
                We finally returned home around 2 AM.

                The next day was all about resting. Temu and his brother spent most of it catching up on sleep after the night out at sea. I wandered around the village and did a little parkour training in the yard - instantly becoming the main attraction for the kids, who wouldn't leave me alone.
                In the evening, I went a bit further past the village to watch the sunset. On the way, I met Matax, one of the few locals who spoke English. He had once worked in Switzerland as a snowboarding instructor - since he was a surfer himself.

                On the last day, there was a big event - tuna fishing. Together with Temu and his brother, we gathered our gear and set out into the open sea. The fishing spot was marked by three buoys, and we cast our bait and waited. We were lucky and managed to catch three big tunas. With such a good haul, we returned home, where Temu prepared the fish - turns out that raw tuna heart is considered a delicacy, although I passed on the offer.
                In the evening, we went to the store and bought a crate of beer (I'm not sure if it was in celebration of my departure or the fish we caught). It turned into quite a party. Temu's cousin joined us, and the four of us drank beer, trying to chat and play marbles (a very popular game throughout Polynesia). Eventually, feeling a little drunk, I went to bed.

                The next day, we had breakfast together, and with a heavy heart, I went to the harbour to catch a boat-taxi that would take me to the airport. I was very sad when I boarded the plane - I remember the thought that was going through my mind: "I've experienced paradise, and I will always long for it."
